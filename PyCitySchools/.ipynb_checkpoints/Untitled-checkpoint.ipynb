    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, data was gathered from 15 different schools to report student performances and determine if students' grade, school type, school size, or per capita budget had any effect on those performances.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One significant finding of this analysis was that per capita budget (i.e. spending per student) had an inverse relationship to student performance.  Schools that had lower spending per student generally reported higher student performances than schools with higher spending per student.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis also demonstrated that small and medium schools (student populations of 2000 or less) reported higher student performances than large schools (student populations above 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "The last conclusion to be drawn from this analysis was that charter schools reported much higher student performances than district schools."
